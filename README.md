An Investigation of the Therac-25 Accidents https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/274940

## Article Summary
This article introduces the Therac-25 accident and the cause of the accident. The authors demonstrate the complex nature of accidents and the need to investigate all aspects of system development and operation in order to prevent future accidents. The authors also present some lessons learned in terms of system engineering, software engineering, and government regulation of safety-critical systems containing software components. It is important to consider the safty of system, such as concurrency and overflow, and document the code nicely when we develop a software.

## Comment by Zhuofeng Wang
The accident introduced by the articel was horrible, and it reminds software enignner to consider more when designing a software. Software engineer should consider problems such as overflow, concurrency. And documentation should be clearer. Software engineer should ensure that others could understand their meanings.
